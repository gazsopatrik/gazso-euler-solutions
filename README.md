# Project Euler Solutions by Gazso

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in **JavaScript**.

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and algorithmic problems intended to be solved through programming. This project is a way for me to improve problem-solving skills, deepen algorithmic thinking, and write clean and efficient JavaScript code.
